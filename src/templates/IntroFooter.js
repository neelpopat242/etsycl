                            Etsy is a global online marketplace, where people come together to make, sell,
                            buy and collect unique items. We’re also a community pushing for 
                            positive change for small businesses,
                            people, and the planet.

                            There’s no Etsy warehouse – just millions of
                            people selling the things they love.
                            We make the whole process easy,
                            helping you connect directly with makers
                            to find something extraordinary.
